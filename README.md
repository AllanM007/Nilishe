## Nilishe
 Nilishe (swahili for feed me) is a pizza delivery web app built using python, django, django-channels, leaflet that enables a user to order pizza and follow the delivery updates in real-time on a map thanks to leaflet and websockets while communicating with the delivery guy through in-built chat with the help of django-channels and redis cache server. Nilishe allows a user to create a profile, view a restaurant's menu, add to cart, remove from cart, in app payments thanks to M-pesa API, leave a review to the delivery guy and recieve a receipt for his/her order.
