## Nilishe
 Nilishe (swahili for feed me) is a pizza delivery web app built using python, django, django-channels, leaflet that enables a user to order pizza and follow the delivery in real-time on a map thanks to leaflet while communicating with the delivery guy through in-built chat with the help of django-channels and redis cache server.
